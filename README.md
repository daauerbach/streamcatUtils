# streamcatUtils
R utility functions for using StreamCat datasets


##Description: 
Please see
https://github.com/USEPA/StreamCat
and 
http://www2.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat
for info on the StreamCat products and processes.

This repo contains working scripts for accessing and manipulating StreamCat data within the [R language](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Scripts depend on an updated base R installation as well as various packages. Some effort has been made to ensure that dependencies are installed and loaded, but this is firmly "research grade" scripting - **_CAVEAT EMPTOR!_**
